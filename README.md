# Computer Assisted Detection of Rare Kidney Diseases in Emergency Departments

This repository contains the model created during a research project in order to detect rare kidney diseases in emergency departments with limited amount of clinical data.

## Usage

Download the stata files for years 2009 to 2020 included from [the NHS](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/dataset_documentation/nhamcs/stata/) and put them in a `data` directory, so that it contains files with the following naming conventions `data/ed-2015-state.dta`.

You can now execute the entire notebook. Note that you will need a GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM to run the training.
